# Doxygen MCP Server
A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides full access to Doxygen's documentation generation capabilities. This server enables AI assistants like Claude to generate, configure, and manage documentation for any supported programming language through a clean, powerful interface.

Refer to the `docs/` directory in this repository for more comprehensive documentation.
